## Directions Specific to this Problem Set

## General Directions for all Problem Sets

1. Fork this repository to create a repository in your own Github account. Then clone your fork to whatever machine you are working on. More detailed directions for this step were given in the README for Problem Set #1: https://github.com/brianhill/cs190-ps1.

2. These problem sets are created with the latest version of Xcode and Mac OS X: XCode 7.2.1 and OS X 10.11.3. Do not run beta versions of Apple's software. During the term, we will probably move to Xcode 7.3, depending on Apple's release schedule. Currently Xcode 7.3 is in beta.

3. Under no circumstances copy-and-paste any part of a solution from another student in the class. Also, under no circumstances ask outsiders on Stack Exchange or other programmers' forums to help you create a solution. It is however fine&mdash;especially when you are truly stuck&mdash;to ask others to help you with your solution, provided you do all of the typing. They should only be looking over your shoulder and commenting.

4. Your solution should be clean and exhibit good style. At minimum, Xcode should not flag warnings of any kind. The style should match Apple's as shown by their examples and declarations. Use the same indentation and spacing around operators as Apple uses. Use their capitalization conventions. Use parts of speech and grammatical number the same way as Apple does.  Use descriptive names for variables, not acronyms or abbreviations. In the Xcode preferences pane, set a page guide at Column 120 and don't exceed it.

5. When completed, and before the time the problem set is due, commit your changes to your fork of the repository. More detailed directions for this step were also given in the README for Problem Set #1. I should be able to simply clone your fork, build it and execute it in my environment without encountering any warnings, adding any dependencies or making any modifications.
